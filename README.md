WARNING: these scripts were created for use by the freeIPA demo server. They no longer work. Continued use is not recommended.

These two scripts try to automatically obtain and install Let's Encrypt certs
to FreeIPA web interface.

To use it, do this:
* BACKUP /var/lib/ipa/certs/ and /var/lib/ipa/private/ to some safe place (it contains private keys!)
* clone/unpack all scripts somewhere
* set EMAIL variable in renew-le.sh
* run setup-le.sh script once to prepare the machine. The script will:
  * install Let's Encrypt client package
  * install Let's Encrypt CA certificates into FreeIPA certificate store
  * requests new certificate for FreeIPA web interface
* run renew-le.sh script once a day: it will renew the cert as necessary

## Service files
* instead of anywhere, clone/unpack all the scripts into `/usr/local/sbin/ipa-certbot/` instead.
* copy `freeipa-certbot.service` and `freeipa-certbot.timer` into `/etc/systemd/system/`
* run `systemctl daemon-reload; systemctl enable freeipa-certbot.service; systemctl enable freeipa-certbot.timer --now`
